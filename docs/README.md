# Exact Capture Documentation
-----------------------------

## mkdocs
Exact capture documentation is written using (mkdocs)[https://www.mkdocs.org/].
All of the documentation pages can be found in markdown format in the `src` directory.
Configuration for mkdocs is found in `mkdocs.yml`.

## Requirements
- python3
- pipenv
- mkdocs

Python2 is now deprecated, with end of support as of 2019.
Python3 has been around for over 10 years, so it's time to move on to Python3.

To ensure a consistent output, the build process uses `pipenv`.
Settings for pipenv can be found in the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`

To install `python3`, run (on Fedora/RedHat/Centos systems)
```
$ sudo yum install python3
```

or  (on Debian/Ubuntu systems)

```
$ sudo apt install python3
```


To install `pip`, run
```
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
$ sudo python get-pip.py
```

To install `pipenv` run
```
$ sudo pip install pipenv
```
**Note**
-----------------
The following error is common on Ubuntu based systems: 

```
    import distutils.spawn
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils.spawn'

Failed to create virtual environment.
```

To resolve you need to install `python3-distuilts`. 
You can do this as follows: 
```
$ sudp apt-get install python3-distutils
```
-----------------


To install `mkdocs` run (inside the exact-capture documentation directory)
```
~/exact-capture/docs $  sudo pipenv install mkdocs
```


## Building
Pipenv is called directly from the makefile. To build simply run:

```
$ make
pipenv run mkdocs build --clean
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
INFO    -  Building documentation to directory: /home/exact-cap/exact-capture/docs/site
```

## Testing
mkdocs ships with a built in server for local testing and viewing of the rendered output.
To test, run:

```
$ make test
pipenv run mkdocs serve
INFO    -  Building documentation...
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
